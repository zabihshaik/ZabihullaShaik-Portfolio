            I was always wishing to write or tell about my First Teacher, my Inspiration, my Motivator, my Best Friend. All these are not different persons. But, same person, who happens to be my Mother. Yes. As they say, Mother's Lap is the First School. 
        </p>
        <h2>The Teacher of All Things</h2>
        <p>
            She did not only teach me ABCs or other alphabets of other languages, but also taught me Values, Humanity, How to Help Others irrespective of who they are and what their background is, etc. She does not only her work herself, but also helps others in their work. She encourages to share the knowledge so that it will only increase our knowledge. And also, share whatever he have, with people who dont have necessary things like food, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Sacrifice for Family</h2>
        <p>
            She sacrificed a lot for our family. She got a Government teacher job in Raichur based on her academic performance in 80s, but had to sacrifice the job for the sake of our family, to take care of children as my Father was busy in business. So, she had that zeal in her to educate all of us(me and my brothers and sisters), and make sure to get good jobs for us so that we can help ourselves and also the people in need. She was always there for us helping in our homeworks, getting ready for school, and all other works which we can't imagine how we would have done without her.
        </p>
        <p>
            She was always with us during our admissions into School, College, Graduation and always discussed with us regarding the decisions about us and motivated us to study well and do well in Exams. Even now, I discuss with her regarding my life and jobs and take a decision based on her advice as she is the one who knows me better and always wishes good for me. :)
