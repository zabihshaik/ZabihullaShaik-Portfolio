           As you can understand from my portfolio that I have done my Masters (M.Tech, CSE) from VIT University, Vellore. I was placed in an IT Company (CS*). But, after completion of M.Tech, the placement got delayed and meanwhile, I had written Bank PO Exams and got selected as Probationary Officer in State Bank of Hyderabad. As I was waiting for call from CS*, I joined the bank. But, later when I received the call, I had to give 2 months notice to Bank, and because of which I lost the opportunity and also had resigned from Bank. Later due to financial constraints, I had to go abroad for a job and move into other field(Accounts and Administration). So, I lost my Programming touch.
        </p>
        <h2>Return to my Field</h2>
        <p>
           Though I had changed my field, it was  good experience for me as I had global exposure and had opportunity to meet a lot of people from different cultures, which increased my communication skills a lot. I was also preparing for Government jobs in India while working. 
           I was always craving to use my skills and develop something. For that, I decided to return to IT and was a bit confused whether to go for a coding job or Data Science job. Though I started Web Development in last quarter of 2020, I was still in a state of dilemma whether to continue or not. I was also learning AWS Cloud Practioner course from Udemy, Professional Data Science Certification from IBM through Coursera whenever I got free time. 
        </p>
        <h2>Finding the Lost love of Programming</h2>
        <p>
          I was not able to complete both of the courses, as I was already into Web Development, and was not able to manage time. But, when I came to know about Tanay Pratap and saw some of his youtube videos(eg. search for 'Which career path to choose? AI or UI?' and also many videos of him related to Web Development), and also came to know about noeG camp(although very late) as I was not into social media much. Then I started from Levelzero to start fresh and learn concepts from Tanay. As he says in one of his videos, Creating brings Positivity and Confidence. It is true as I am now loving creating apps, and I found my lost love in Programming. Have a long way to go, but I think I am in right path by following the right person, who I wish if I had come across long time ago, it would have been different altogether till now, but still it's a good thing for me to find neoG camp to showcase my skills and learnings.
