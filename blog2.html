           As you can understand from my portfolio that I have done my Masters (M.Tech, CSE) from VIT University, Vellore. I was placed in an IT Company (CS*). But, after completion of M.Tech, the placement got delayed and meanwhile, I had written Bank PO Exams an got selected as PO of SBH. As I was waiting for call from CS*, I joined the bank. But, later when I received the call, I should give 2 months notice to Bank, and because of which I lost the opportunity and also had resigned from Bank. Later due to Financial constraints, I had to move into other filed(Accounts and Administration). So, I lost my Programming touch.

        <h2>Finding the Lost love of Programming</h2>
        <p>
        As I decided to move to my Own Field, I have been doing Web Developing since nearly 1 year. But, I was not that motivated or Loving it. But, when I came to know about noeG camp(although very late), I started from Levelzero to start fresh and learn concepts from Tanay. I am now loving it and I found my lost love in Programming.
